# Video classification using CNN3D
 Video classification with a 3D convolutional neural network
This tutorial demonstrates training a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for video classification using the UCF101 action recognition dataset. A 3D CNN uses a three-dimensional filter to perform convolutions. The kernel can slide in three directions, whereas in a 2D CNN it can slide in two dimensions. The model is based on the work published in A Closer Look at Spatiotemporal Convolutions for Action Recognition by D. Tran et al. (2017). The resulting accuracy is low due to the restricted number of epochs ( I trained only with 5 epochs for time efficiency where 50 or more epochs are proper).
